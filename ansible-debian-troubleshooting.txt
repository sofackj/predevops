Lab Setup â€“ Troubleshooting Tips
If you are following along the demo to setup lab, please refer to the below troubleshooting tips:

Only 32bit VMs are listed in Virtual Box
While creating VMs in Virtual box if only 32-bit vms are listed, kindly check on the following:

Check if Virtualization is enabled on your system. For this, you must access the BIOS of your laptop and enable Virtualization if its not already enabled.
Check if Hyper-V is enabled on your system. If it is, ensure that it is disabled as two virtualization technologies cannot co-exist.
Issues installing Ansible and its dependencies on Debian
If you are running into issues installing Ansible on Debian VM then please follow the below troubleshooting guide.

Once the Debian VM is up and running make the following changes to the /etc/apt/sources.list file to get the Ansible installation working right.

Comment the line starting deb cdrom
Uncomment bottom two lines starting deb and deb-src
Add the below two lines:
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ansible/ansible/ubuntu trusty main
deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian sid main
Final file:

#
# deb cdrom:[Debian GNU/Linux 8.9.0 _Jessie_ - Official amd64 DVD Binary-1 20170723-11:49]/ jessie contrib main
#deb cdrom:[Debian GNU/Linux 8.9.0 _Jessie_ - Official amd64 DVD Binary-1 20170723-11:49]/ jessie contrib main
#deb http://deb/debian.org/debian jessie main
#deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch main
deb http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main contrib
deb-src http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main contrib
# jessie-updates, previously known as 'volatile'
# A network mirror was not selected during install.  The following entries
# are provided as examples, but you should amend them as appropriate
# for your mirror of choice.
#
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ jessie-updates main contrib
deb-src http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ jessie-updates main contrib
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ansible/ansible/ubuntu trusty main
deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian sid main
Once file is updated, run apt-get update and then run apt-get install ansible

Enabling SSH on the VM
If you need SSH enabled on the system, follow the below steps:

Ensure the /etc/apt/sources.list file has been updated as per above
Run the command: apt-get update
Run the command: apt-get install openssh-server
Run the command: service sshd start
